# Personal Website

This is my personal Website, which you can finde [here](https://realeaz.de/).

## Set up

Copy everything of the src folder to your project folder.

## Personalize

In the code you will have to change the social media links to your own pages and add the imprint (impressum.php) and the privacy policy (datenschutz.php). Also you can edit the filenames but then you have to change the href attribute. Also you have to change the text to your own.
